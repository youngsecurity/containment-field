## Purpose
GitLab has implemented the concept of “least privilege” through limiting access to the organization’s systems and data to authorized users only.

## Scope
This control applies to any system or service where user accounts can be provisioned.

## Ownership
The owner of this control is IT Operations and People Operations.

## Controls
